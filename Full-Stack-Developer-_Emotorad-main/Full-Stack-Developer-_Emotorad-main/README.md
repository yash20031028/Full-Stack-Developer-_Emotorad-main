This project is a full-stack dashboard using React.js for the frontend and Node.js + Express for the backend. It includes Google OAuth for user authentication, CRUD functionality with MongoDB for data storage, and data visualization using Chart.js. The frontend components (Sidebar, Navbar, Profile, and Dashboard) create a polished UI, while Axios handles API requests between frontend and backend. The backend is built with RESTful endpoints for managing user and data records.
